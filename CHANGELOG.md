# Change Log

All notable changes to the "go-to-character" extension will be documented in this file.

## v2.0

- Add support for the plugin to be used in a visual studio code editor running in the browser. For example, when pressing <kbd>.</kbd> on [github.dev](https://github.dev) while checking code, it will show a visual studio code editor and this extension is supported in those environments now
- Add support for [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust). The extension is fully supported in Restricted Mode as it does not need Workspace Trust to perform any functionality

## v1.0

- Initial release
