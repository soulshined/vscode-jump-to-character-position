# ![icon](./images/icon.png) Go To Character Position

## Features

Quickly jump to an absolute position of the active editor, regardless of the line or column number.

Useful if you want to jump to a character position or specific index (zero based)

## Keyboard Shorcut

- The default keyboard shortcut (win) for jumping to a column/line is <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>
- The keyboard shorcut for jumping to a character position extends that, using: <kbd>ctrl+k</kbd> + <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>

*For macs replace the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> modifier with <kbd>cmd</kbd>*

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `go-to-character-position.defaultIndex`: set your default position index to be zero based or one based
* `go-to-character-position.revealType`: This determines the behavior of how your viewport will scroll to an index that isn't currently within the bounds of what you see

**Enjoy!**
