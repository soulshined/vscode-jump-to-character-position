# ![icon](./images/icon.png) Go To Character Position

## Features

Quickly jump to an absolute position of the active editor, regardless of the line or column number.

Useful if you want to jump to a character position or specific index (zero based)

## Keyboard Shorcut

- The default keyboard shortcut (win) for jumping to a column/line is <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>
- The keyboard shorcut for jumping to a character position extends that, using: <kbd>ctrl+k</kbd> + <kbd>ctrl+g</kbd>

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `go-to-character-position.defaultIndex`: set your default position index to be zero based or one based
* `go-to-character-position.revealType`: This determines the behavior of how your viewport will scroll to an index that isn't currently within the bounds of what you see
* `go-to-character-position.statusbar.priority` : This allows you to move the status bar item from right to left. The lower the number to 0, the farther right the status bar item will be, the higher the number from 0 the farther left the item will be

**Enjoy!**
